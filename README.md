ðŸš€ **Ub**untu set**up** utility.

Automate the steps you run after installing Ubuntu in a declarative way.

## Demo

[![asciicast demo](https://asciinema.org/a/ez4shsis8aCZBsHdIP7NxO4p1.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/ez4shsis8aCZBsHdIP7NxO4p1)

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 16.04 or later (Python >= 3.5)

## Configuration

Setup configuration is stored in declarative `setup.yaml` files. They consist
of three types of elements: actions, categories and metadata.

### Actions

Categories and metadata are optional features, meaning you can create a
completely valid and functional `setup.yaml` files by using actions only:

```yaml
$folders:
  - ~/Apps
  - ~/Projects
$apt-packages:
  - fish
  - cowsay
$snap-packages:
  - vscode
  - discord
$scriptlet: |
  echo "Hello world :D"
$scripts:
  - myscript.sh
```

As you might have guessed, keys beginning with `$` (e.g. `$folders`,
`$apt-packages`) and their values are called actions. They represent setup
instructions in your configuration.

Their names (or keys), schemata and functionalities are defined by plugins.
There is a set of [built-in plugins](#built-in-plugins) that ship with ubup.

If you cannot find an existing plugin that fits your need, you can ...

* write your own bash script ...
  * inline via the [`scriptlet` plugin](#scriptlet)
  * in a seperate file, referencing it using the [`scripts` plugin](#scripts)
* create your own [custom plugin](#custom-plugins)

Sequence matters in many cases and therefore the order of actions is
preserved when ubup performs your setup.

### Categories

To archive a more organized structure, you can use optional categories.

```yaml
apps:
  $snap-packages:
    - chromium
    - vlc
  appimages:
    foo:
      $scriptlet: |
        # ...
    bar:
      # ...
  # ...
```

All keys that don't start with `$` and that are not metadata keys are
treated as categories. Their main purpose is to support a better structure.

Categories can contain subcategories or actions and the order of categories
is preserved.

### Metadata

Optionally, you can specify some additional metadata:

```yaml
author: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
description: |
  Tested on Ubuntu 17.10
  ...
setup:
  foo: # category
    $apt-packages: # action
      # ...
```

Where `setup` contains the root for all categories and actions.
You may not mix metadata with actions or categories and metadata keys
are not allowed to be reused as category names.

Supported metadata keys are:
* `author: <str>`: The author of the configuration file
* `description: <str>`: A description of the configuration file

## Perform Setup

To perform your setup, simply run

```
./path/to/ubup/setup
```

in the folder that contains your `setup.yaml`.

## Configuration with Git

By creating a Git repository with your configuration, you can
not only easily host it on your preferred Git hosting service but
you can also add ubup as a Git submodule. This minimizes your
installation steps and ensures you always run with a version
of ubup that you tested your setup against.

Create a new repository:

```
mkdir ubuntu-post-install && cd ubuntu-post-install
git init
```

Add the `ubup` repository as a submodule:

```
# Note: It will be recommended to use the master branch to
# ensure you run with a stable version of ubup.
# There is no stable release and therefore no master branch, yet.
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/tim-sueberkrueb/ubup.git
git submodule update --init
```

Create your `setup.yaml`.

You can now run `./ubup/setup` inside your repository
to perform your setup.

## Built-in Plugins

### apt-packages

Install a set of packages via `apt`.

```yaml
$apt-packages:
  - foo
  - bar
  # ...
```

### folders

Create a set of folders unless they already exist.
You can use `~` or `$HOME` as placeholders for the home directory
and `$USER` as placeholder for the username of the current user.

```yaml
$folders:
  - foo
  - bar
  # ...
```

### ppas

Add a set of PPAs unless they are already active.
PPAs must be provided in the format `user/ppa` as opposed to `ppa:user/ppa`
since the action name `$ppas` makes it obvious that the repository to add
is a ppa.

```yaml
$ppas:
  - foo/bar
  - alexlarsson/flatpak
  # ...
```

### scriptlet

Run an inline bash script snippet.

```yaml
$scriptlet: |
    echo "Hello World"
    # ...
```

### scripts

Run a set of separate bash scripts.

```yaml
$scripts:
  - hello.sh
  - scripts/foo.sh
  - scripts/bar.sh
```

### snap-packages

Install a set of snap packages.

You can either just define the names of the packages to install or
provide a dictionary with additional options in the following schema:
```
<snap-package>:
    <option-key>: <option-value>
```

The following options are supported:

* `classic: <true|false>`: Toggle classic [confinement](https://docs.snapcraft.io/reference/confinement)
* `channel: <track>/<risk level>/<branch>`: [Snap channel](https://docs.snapcraft.io/reference/channels)
* `jailmode <true|false>`: Toggle enforcement of strict [confinement](https://docs.snapcraft.io/reference/confinement)
* `devmode <true|false>`: Toggle developer mode [confinement](https://docs.snapcraft.io/reference/confinement)

```yaml
$snap-packages:
  - foo
  - bar:
      classic: true
      channel: latest/stable
      jailmode: false
      devmode: false
```

## Custom Plugins

Custom plugins can be created in a folder called `plugins`
next to the `setup.yaml`.
This folder may contain a set of Python files (`*.py`).
Each Python file may contain one or more
Python classes with a class name ending with `Plugin` (e.g. `BarPlugin`,
`MyPlugin` and even `Plugin` are valid plugin class names).

**Note:** There is one exception: you may not call your plugin class
`AbstractPlugin`. If you do so, the class will be simply ignored.

ubup provides a lightweight plugin API which can be imported using

```python
import ubup.plugins
```

It mainly provides the abstract base class `AbstractPlugin`
which serves as the skeleton for custom (as well as built-in)
plugins.

---

Hint:

```python
from ubup.plugins import AbstractPlugin
```
is equivalent to

```python
from ubup import AbstractPlugin
```

---

A hello world plugin `plugins/hello-world.py` is as simple as:

```python
from ubup import AbstractPlugin

class HelloPlugin(AbstractPlugin):
    key = 'hello'
    schema = str

    def perform(self):
        print(f"Hello {self.config}!")

```

`key` must be a unique name you will later reference the plugin
by in your `setup.yaml`.

`schema` must be set to a valid Python data structure that
will be validated using the Python [schema library](https://github.com/keleshev/schema).

`perform` must define whatever you want to run when your
plugin is performed.

`self.config` holds the user configuration.

This would be a valid `setup.yaml` for this example plugin:

```yaml
$hello: world
```

`self.config` will contain the string `"world"`.

This wouldn't be a valid configuration for this example plugin:

```yaml
$hello:
  - a
  - b
  - c
```

because we set `schema = str`.

If you think your plugin could be useful for other users as well,
please feel encouraged to create a pull request to add it as built-in plugin!

The same goes for extending or improving existing plugins, of course.
